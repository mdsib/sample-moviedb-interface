# Sample MovieDB Interface

A simple, currently unstyled react/redux app for discovering movies by popularity and name.

### Requirements
- Node.js
- Npm

### Installation
- install: `npm install`
- set environmental variable `MDB_API_KEY=keyhashhere`
- launch dev server using `npm start`

### Motivations
I've been learning about React and Redux recently, and thought this would be a good project to solidify some of my understanding of how the two work together.

### To Do / Next Steps
- Error handling for individual movies.
- Styling.
- Refactoring MovieDB module for DRY.
- Production server config.
- Get rid of jquery for something lighter.
- More Tests.
- Map movie data to another object rather than using what the API returns.
